## 🎯 Quick Start Testing

### 5-Minute Smoke Test

```
1. "Create a logo for my bakery"
   → Answer dialogue questions naturally
   → Check verification report

2. "skip dialogue: Generate abstract art with vibrant colors"
   → Should generate immediately
   → Still shows verification checklist

3. List all conversations

4. Resume last conversation and refine: "Make it brighter"
```

**Success = All 4 work without errors**

---

## 📋 Comprehensive Test Plan

See **PHASE1_TEST_PLAN.md** for:
- 6 detailed scenarios with specific prompts
- Image type testing (logo, presentation, social, etc.)
- Verification testing guidelines
- Edge cases and error handling
- Success metrics and feedback template

---

## 🎨 Specific Test Prompts

### Logo (Guided Mode - Default)
```
Create a logo for my coffee shop called "Sunrise Roasters"
```
**Expected:** 3-5 questions about branding, style, colors, simplicity

### TRON Scene (Skip Mode)
```
Skip dialogue mode. Generate a TRON movie style scene with a figure
standing on a glowing digital grid, neon cyan and magenta lights,
text overlay saying "INNOVATE 2025" in futuristic font,
cinematic lighting
```
**Expected:** Direct generation + verification checklist mentioning text

### Social Media (Quick Mode)
```
Create an Instagram post announcing our new product launch
```
**Expected:** 1-2 quick questions + square size auto-detected

### Presentation (Explorer Mode)
```
Create a professional presentation background for a tech conference keynote
```
**Expected:** 6+ detailed questions + landscape size

### Iterative Refinement
```
1. "Create a cozy coffee shop interior"
2. "Make it more modern with industrial elements"
3. "Add more plants and warmer lighting"
```
**Expected:** Context maintained, no new dialogue questions

## 🔍 What the Verification System Does

**Before (Your TRON Example):**
- Generated street sign with vines ❌
- Told you it was ready ❌
- You had to discover the failure ❌

**Now (With Verification):**
- Generates image
- **Checks requirements checklist:**
  - ✓ Subject matter: TRON scene
  - ✓ Visual elements: Digital grid, neon lights
  - ✓ Text presence: "INNOVATE 2025"
  - ✓ Colors: Cyan and magenta
  - ✓ Style: Cinematic, futuristic
- Shows verification report with reminders
- You can review before accepting

**Note:** Phase 1 verification shows checklists and reminders but doesn't block delivery. Future phases can add vision-based checks to automatically detect mismatches.

## 🚀 How to Test

### Option 1: With Claude Desktop (Recommended)

1. **Restart Claude Desktop** completely (Cmd+Q, then reopen)
2. **Try a dialogue test:**
   ```
   Create a logo for my tech startup
   ```
3. **Answer the questions naturally**
4. **Check the response for:**
   - ✅ Verification report
   - ✅ Requirement checklist
   - ✅ File path to image
   - ✅ Conversation ID

### Option 2: Run Unit Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
./run_tests.sh

# Or specific categories
./run_tests.sh quick        # Unit tests only
./run_tests.sh integration  # Integration tests
./run_tests.sh coverage     # With coverage report
```

## 🐛 Known Limitations & Future Enhancements

### Phase 1 Limitations
- ✅ **Verification creates checklists** but doesn't actually "see" the image yet
- ✅ **Always passes images** - provides guidance but doesn't block
- ✅ **Reminds you to check** key requirements manually

### Future Enhancements (Phase 2+)
- 🔮 Vision-based verification using Claude's image analysis
- 🔮 Automatic mismatch detection ("this looks nothing like the prompt")
- 🔮 Confidence scoring based on actual image content
- 🔮 Automatic refinement suggestions based on image analysis
- 🔮 Batch generation with variations

## 🔧 Debugging

If something doesn't work:

```bash
# Check storage directory
ls -la ~/.openai-images-mcp/conversations/

# View conversation
cat ~/.openai-images-mcp/conversations/conv_*.json | head -50

# Check recent images
ls -lt ~/Downloads/openai_image_* | head -5

# View logs
tail -f ~/Library/Logs/Claude/mcp-server-openai-images.log

# Run tests
pytest tests/ -v
```

## 📝 Feedback Needed

Please test and provide feedback on:

1. **Dialogue Flow**
   - Were questions helpful?
   - Felt natural or robotic?
   - Preferred mode (quick/guided/explorer)?

2. **Verification System**
   - Was the checklist helpful?
   - Did it remind you of key things to check?
   - Suggestions for improvement?

3. **Overall Experience**
   - Faster to get good results?
   - Worth the dialogue overhead?
   - Any bugs or issues?

4. **Specific Issues**
   - Which prompts failed?
   - What didn't work as expected?
   - Any error messages?

## 🎯 What We're Testing For

### Primary Goal
**Does dialogue + enhancement + verification lead to better images on first try?**

### Secondary Goals
- Does verification catch/remind about obvious mismatches?
- Is the dialogue flow helpful or annoying?
- Does storage/resumption work reliably?
- Is the overall UX better than simple generation?

---

## 🚀 Ready to Test!

Start with the **5-minute smoke test** above, then:
- Try the TRON scene (your example) to see verification in action
- Test a logo with full dialogue
- Try skip mode for complex prompts
- Test conversation resumption

**See PHASE1_TEST_PLAN.md for detailed scenarios!**

---

**Questions or issues?** Just describe what happened and we can debug together.

**Happy testing!** 🎨✨
